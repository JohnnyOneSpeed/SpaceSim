For those considering the business case for the subscale BFR, attached is a simulation of a GTO mission. The 3/4 scale ship should be able to deliver a 40mT payload to GTO, allowing for re-use, and a slightly supersynchronous transfer orbit. Even allowing for the extra mass of a carousel, it should be possible to deliver 5-6 x 6mT satellites in the one mission.

The IAC Mexico presentation suggested a cost per tonne to Mars of $140,000. Does anyone have a sense of the cost for the scaled system to LEO/GTO?

If the Raptor engines turned out to have a 75% smaller diameter than envisioned.
You could either reduce the diameter of the BFR by 75% to 9 meter or increase the number of Raptors to 100 for a 12 meter diameter (42/0,42=100)

The reason why SpaceX reduced the rocket diameter is crucial here, if it was 75% engine size, booster engine count would still be 42 for the scalled BFR.

Thrust is proportional to area.
If the full scale SL Raptors are 1.51m√ò and generate 300mT of thrust, 3/4 scale versions would generate 300 x 0.5625 = 168.75mT of thrust.
For the ITS, 300 x 42 = 12,600mT, giving a liftoff T/W of 12,600 / 10,500 = 1.2.
The mass of the 3/4 scale rocket would be 10,500 x 0.421875 = 4430mT.
For the same T/W the scaled rocket would require 4430 * 1.2 = 5316mT of thrust, giving 5316 / 168.75 = 31.5 engines, not 42.
For 42 engines, the required thrust would be 5316 / 42 = 126.6mT each. That is an area ratio of 0.422, for a linear scale of 0.6496 or 65%.

The scaled rocket would require 17.7 full scale Raptor 40 engines, but 16 Raptor 40+ would give similar performance.
I'll leave it to the economists to work out which would be cheaper to produce: 16 x Raptor 40+, 32 at 75% scale, or 42 at 65% scale.

Inspired in part by a stunning NASA poster of the Apollo mission profile, here is a speculative simulation of a scaled BFS moon cargo mission, in three parts:

1. Trans lunar injection (TLI) from LEO to low lunar orbit (LLO).
2. Lunar landing from LLO.
3. Return from the lunar surface to LEO.

The initial mass of the BFS is 2,590 * 0.422 = 1092.8mT.
This gives a payload to the moon of 57.2mT. I've assumed a 10mT return payload, so 47.2mT to the lunar surface.
The masses at some of the mission phases are:
