There's some old information I was reading again with regards to how SpaceX plan to get these ships back from Mars.  They didn't intend to use a de-orbit burn or a reentry burn for the task.  The catch is that because they're moving with so much velocity, they can't simply come straight in to land on Earth.  Instead, the plan (at that time) was for the returning ships to aerocapture into Earth orbit.  This would work by skimming through the atmosphere between 60-70 km up,pointing its lift downward to capture into negative C3 all while maxing out at about 1.9 G of deceleration, with an inertial entry FPA of around -5.85 degrees and inertial velocity of 12.5 km/s.  The ship would first aerocapture into orbit, use a second atmospheric entry to slow down into LEO (if possible), and then finally come in to land during the 3rd atmospheric entry.  

Yes, you read right--SpaceX plan on traveling into the Earth's atmosphere at least 3 times on the return trip.  If they didn't slow enough by the 3rd try, they'd just do it another time.  It's little wonder they planned on replacing the heat shield after these missions.  Peak heating for aerocapture is estimated to be 608 W/cm^2, which is actually higher than even peak heating for a fast 9 km/s Mars entry (586 W/cm^2).  The final impulse required to land was estimated to be around 400-500 m/s for the Ship due to this method, some 350 m/s less than at Mars.  Final landing entry would see the ship enter at about 60 degrees from attitude, make a corrective burn after reorienting itself, and then make a final landing burn while still traveling at mach 0.4.  

Any takers on simulating this?

The stainless steel Starship will apparently have the same general arrangement (and aerodynamics) as the 2018 BFR. Dry mass will be slightly less, so payload could be slightly improved. The Raptor specifications are in a state of flux at the moment, but aerocapture from Mars return doesn't necessarily require the engines, so here's a shot at simulating it.

I found a slightly increased FPA (-7.5Â°) from Hyperion5's 2016 figures worked with the increased lift of the 2018 fins, and allowed level (inverted) flight at about 69kms, with peak gs of only 1.58. Due to the increased altitude, the peak combined conductive and radiative heat flux is slightly less at 5.46 MW/m[sup]2[/sup] (vs 608 W/cm[sup]2[/sup] = 6.08 MW/m[sup]2[/sup]). From the attached spreadsheet, for 11.6km/s, a 4.5m radius, and 69km altitude, the bulk of the flux is radiative, so the recent change to the use of transpiration cooling combined with a highly reflective finish certainly makes sense. If the methane film is still liquid, then reflection would occur at two interfaces, the surface of the film, and the polished stainless steel skin. The reflectivity of liquid methane is about 0.2, and polished stainless steel can be over 0.9. So, the total flux transmitted would be 0.8 * 0.1 = 8% or lower.

Over a screen capture of the attached short video, I've superimposed an 'artist's impression' of the hypersonic flow over the Starship at peak heat flux. I suspect that the flow over the fins will start at the root, and continue out towards the tip, spilling forward and aft over what would conventionally be considered the leading and trailing edges.
