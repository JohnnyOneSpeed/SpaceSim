What's the duration of the burn?

About a minute. For what it's worth, here is the output from my Inmarsat-5 sim. The orbit at SECO1 is about 160 x 590 kms, and mass is 25.5mT. At SECO2, mass is 11.6mT. A 4° plane change from 28.5 to 24.5° would require an additional 540m/s, for a burn to depletion S2 total of 9.9mT. Subtracting 6.1mT for the satellite, gives 3.8mT S2 dry mass, a bit lower than I would have expected.
